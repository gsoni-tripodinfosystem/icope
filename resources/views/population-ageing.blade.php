            As age advances, a gradual decrease in physical and mental capacity occurs. This leads to 
an increased risk of disease and ultimately, death. Beyond biological changes, ageing is 
also associated with other life transitions such as retirement, relocation to more appropriate 
housing, and the death of friends and partners. In developing a public-health response to 
ageing, it is important to not just consider approaches that ameliorate the losses associated 
with older age, but also those that may reinforce recovery, adaptation and psychosocial growth.

            <h3 class="bodyModule"><strong>Demography of population ageing</strong></h3>
            <p>
            The population of older people has been increasing globally as well at the regional level. 
Virtually every Member State of the World Health Organization’s South-East Asia (SEA) 
Region is experiencing growth in the numbers and proportions of older people among their 
populations.

            <h3 class="bodyModule"><strong>Factors promoting healthy ageing</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>1. </strong>Although some of the variations in older people’s health are genetic, much is due to people’s 
physical and social environments – including their homes and communities, as well as 
their personal characteristics – such as their gender, ethnicity or socioeconomic status.
These factors start to influence the ageing process right from an early age.

            </p>
            <p><strong>2. </strong>
            Maintaining healthy behaviour throughout life, particularly eating a balanced diet, engaging 
in regular physical activity and refraining from tobacco use, all contribute to reducing the 
risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and improving physical and mental capacity.
            <p>
            <p><strong>3. </strong>
            Supportive environments enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses 
in capacity. The availability of safe and accessible public buildings and transport, and 
environments that are easy to walk around, are examples of supportive environments.
