      <p>The world is ageing, and the WHO South-East Asia Region is no 
exception. Almost all countries in the Region are experiencing rapid 
growth in the number and proportion of older people. The proportion 
of people in the Region over the age of 60 is currently more than 10%, 
which is expected to double over the next three decades. By 2050 
the proportion of people in the Region over the age of 80 is expected 
to triple, from 1% to 3%.</p>
<p>
To ensure that all older people in the Region can access quality 
health care that meets their health needs, countries must develop a health workforce that is 
appropriately trained, deployed and managed. As highlighted by the WHO Decade of Healthy 
Ageing and outlined in the Regionâ€™s Framework of Healthy Ageing 2018-2022, critical to 
achieving this objective is the dissemination of appropriate training tools for strengthening the 
competencies of diff erent categories of health personnel within the health workforce. 
</p>
<p>
All countries have now been oriented on the WHO-Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) 
approach, which will help stakeholders in health and social care understand, design, and 
implement a person-centred and coordinated model of care. This training package for frontline 
and community-based health workers encompasses the concept of ICOPE and provides 
guidance to help them promptly identify possible declines in intrinsic capacity and functional 
ability, enabling them to address such declines eff iciently and with available resources. I urge 
all stakeholders to use this package to strengthen the capacity of frontline health workers to 
promote healthy ageing so that together we can achieve the future we want for present and 
coming generations.
